tweber's keymap
=================
My layout is based on the default layout with the following changes:

- leave out the dvorak and colemak layouts for  simplicity.
- swap ctrl + adjust keys
- swap super + alt keys
- configure RGBW leds and RGB animations
- put page up/down keys on LOWER up/down
- put HOME and END keys on LOWER left/right
- put cursor keys on ADJUST h,j,k,l keys
- add us international ALT_GR combinations for german umlauts on ADJUST
- move reset to ADJUST ESC
- use Mod-Tap to add rctrl+rshift modifier on ESC key
  -> this is nice for copy + pasting inside terminals
- configure audio feature using buzzer connected to C6 and ground.  
  Sadly, memory size is only allows RGBLIGHT or AUDIO to be enabled. Also both left and right sides need to be flashed the same.


### future improvements

- use the nice!nano board for bluetooth support? see <https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/gst1n6/ic_nicenano_the_super_thin_wireless_bluetooth/>
