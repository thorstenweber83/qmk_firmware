tweber's keymap
=================
My layout is based on the default layout with the following changes:

- leave out the dvorak and colemak layouts for  simplicity.
- swap ctrl + adjust keys
- swap super + alt keys
- configure RGBW leds and RGB animations
- put page up/down keys on LOWER up/down
- put HOME and END keys on LOWER left/right
- put cursor keys on ADJUST h,j,k,l keys
- add us international ALT_GR combinations for german umlauts on ADJUST
- move reset to ADJUST ESC
- use Mod-Tap to add rctrl+rshift modifier on ESC key
  -> this is nice for copy + pasting inside terminals
